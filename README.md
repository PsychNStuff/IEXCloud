# IEXCloud
### How to use IEXCloud
Make an account at IEXCloud.io
You will need to use an API key. If you want to use IEXCloud to really track stocks, do not use the sandbox, use the real version; note that this has not been tested. Otherwise, just follow the instructions for the sandbox.

### Using this notebook
Feel free to run this code in python or conda. Otherwise, as this is a notebook, you can use Jupyter notebook or Google collab easily.

### Note
This code was made for a badger through a class in python on data wrangling offered by Arizona State University.
